    <p>Khinakli is traditional Georgian dish. It is a variation of asian dumplings but a bit more complicated.
       There are different types of Khinaklis made in Georgia but "mountain type" and "city type" Khinaklis are 
       two most common ones.</p>
    <p>The most important ingredient for preparation of Khinkali is meat. Nowadays <strong>beef</strong> is a usual meat of choice, 
       but traditional Khinakli is made from <strong> sheep meat</strong>. </p>
